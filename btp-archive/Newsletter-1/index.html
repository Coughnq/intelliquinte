                    <h3 style="color: #363737;">The Purpose</h3>
                    <p>I want to provide you with an authentic reason for why I’ve created this newsletter. Consistency is an area where I struggle, and committing to create a newsletter every Friday reflecting on my daily life will set a goal for me each week. It’s also a way for me to reflect on my mental growth. These newsletters will serve as a reminder of who I am and what I am capable of. Additionally, they will enhance my portfolio and offer a means to make a small impact in my community.</p>
                    <p>This platform allows me to speak freely, without feeling overshadowed by the noise around us. It marks the beginning of my journey towards becoming the person I aspire to be, and I want you to be a part of that journey.</p>
                    <p>Many people don’t realize the weight that words carry, especially for those with big dreams. I am one of those people. Depending on your intentions, your words can either uplift or bring me down. I understand and accept whichever side you choose to be on.</p>
                    <p>I aim to make a great first impression, as they tend to last the longest.</p>
                    <p>In the second newsletter, I will share my very own Non-Negotiable Values List (NNVL). It’s for you to acknowledge my values as a person. This list will also provide insight into my character and serve as a way for you to hold me accountable.</p>
                    <p>I encourage you to create your own NNVL as well. If you’re up for it, email me your list and include the reasons behind each Non-Negotiable item.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
                    <p>To help you understand your boundaries and where you stand. A few weeks ago, I felt lost and was willing to go to great lengths to do things I normally wouldn’t. Reading the news added to my sense of fear. Creating this NNVL has helped me understand what I am and am not willing to do.</p>
                    <p>If you also feel a sense of hopelessness, make an NNVL. While I can’t promise it will change your entire life, it’s definitely a start. Take your time to create it—it doesn’t have to be finished in a day. It’s for your reflection on your values so we can improve together on this long journey ahead.</p>
                    <p>Whether you’re in your 50s or 17 years old, we all have a lot to learn from others’ perspectives and ideas. We don’t have to agree, but it can be enlightening to listen.</p>
                    <P>Nowadays, it seems like everyone wants to talk and be heard but not listen.</P>
                    <p>So, let this be a reminder: use your mouth less and your ears more.</p>

                        <p>Here's a project I'm currrently working on:</p>

                        <img src="/images/newsletter/project-1.jpg" alt="Wall with Abner's writings taped to it." width="200" style="text-align: center;">

                        <p><strong>What Is It?</strong></p>
                        <p>It’s soon going to be an entire wall full of my writings. I plan to turn it into a piece that I can reflect on and look back on in my later years. It’s something I want to be proud of. I’ll provide you with an update in my next newsletter!</p>
